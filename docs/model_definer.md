# function **model_definer**
The `model_definer` function defines a flow-based model using the `nflows` library. The model is defined using a base distribution (StandardNormal) and a series of transformations. The transformations include
RandomPermutation and MaskedAffineAutoregressiveTransform. The CompositeTransform combines all the transformations.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the learning rate is reduced using the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler.

The function also prints the number of iterations, number of hidden features, and number of trainable parameters in the model.

The code is contained in the `model.py` file.

**Parameters**:

* `num_features` : The number of input features for the model.
* `num_iterations` : The number of base distributions to generate the flow.
* `hidden_features` : The number of hidden features in the MaskedAffineAutoregressiveTransform.
* `patience` : The number of epochs with no improvement after which the learning rate will be reduced.
* `factor` : The factor by which the learning rate will be reduced.
* `min_lr` : The minimum learning rate.
* `initial_lr` : The initial learning rate.

**Returns**:
* `flow` : The flow-based model.
* `optimizer` : The optimizer used for training the model.
* `scheduler` : The learning rate scheduler.
