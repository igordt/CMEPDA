## Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to implement a lossy compression, using flow-based generative models.
The realization is obtained using Affine Autoregressive Flows, an example of [Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762). As an application of Normalizing Flows, it was also shown how new data can be generated from the Gaussian distributions into which the original data are mapped.

This work was inspired by the [Baler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02283) tool development, where a lossy compression is realized through an autoencoder. For this reason the datasets used were the same, so that a comparison could be made.

In this project, compression with two different models was studied, so the files `original_model1.ipynb` and `original_model2.ipynb` were created.

The document `Description_of_the_project_Callisti_Carotta_DiTota` contains the more detailed explanation, along with the results obtained, and is available in this repo.
