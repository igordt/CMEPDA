## Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to implement a lossy compression, using flow-based generative models.
Two realizations are proposed: the first is obtained using Affine Autoregressive Flows, as an example of [Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762); the second is based on [Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747), the continuous generalization of the first case.

This work was inspired by the [Baler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02283) tool development, where a lossy compression is realized through an autoencoder. For this reason the datasets used were the same, so that a comparison could be made.

The document containing the more detailed explanation, along with the results obtained, is available here.
